# Liquid Voting as a Service (POC)

Proof of concept for a liquid voting service that can be easily plugged into proposal-making platforms of different kinds.

Part fun itch scratcher, part résumé-driven development.

TODO:

* Graphql API for voting, delegating and subscribing to voting results
* dockerization
* kuberization
* tests
* logging
* monitoring
* perf tests
* CI/CD
* JS widget
* Auth
