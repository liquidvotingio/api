# Contributing

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

Issues and pull requests are very welcome for bug reports and feature requests and/or proposals.

Please provide as much information as possible, describing the bug or feature in detail. Screenshots and videos are great.

All code needs to include programmatic tests, and to have been tested manually as well. Tests will run on [the repo's CI](https://github.com/liquidvotingio/api/actions), and should pass before asking for a PR review.

If you're interested in contributing to the project long term (every skill level welcome), let us know [over email](mailto:oli.azevedo.barnes@gmail.com)  and we'll onboard you through a call and invite you to our slack.

Please note that for all communication and interactions we expect our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to be followed.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found at

- The [liquidvoting.io](https://liquidvoting.io) website, edited on its [github page repo](https://github.com/liquidvotingio/liquidvotingio.github.io)
- READMES for [the api](https://github.com/liquidvotingio/api) and [auth]([api](https://github.com/liquidvotingio/api) repos
- Code comments
- Tests

Keeping docs up to date are part of daily work: whenever we add a new feature, they are part of the delivery. Of course, stuff sometimes falls through the cracks but whenever we notice some documentation is missing, we either add it or create an issue for it in case it's more involved.

### doctests and typespecs

These are currently optional, nice to have. But we're experimenting with them, and they might be fully adopted in the future.
